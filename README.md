Hacker News Site Analysis

This is guided project for the Data Analyst in Python Certification in Dataquest

In this project I am going to analyze a data set from a Hacker News site

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

Post on this site are normally categorized as "asks" to the community or as "show" to the community.

I'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

Do "asks" posts or "show" posts receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
